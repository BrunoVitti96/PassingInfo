Below is a didactic explanation of LangGraph’s main concepts and a simple example that starts from one node, goes to a second node, and then uses a conditional edge to decide whether to execute a function (tool) or a prompt. I’ll explain every step as if you’re new to Python classes.

Overview of LangGraph

LangGraph is a framework that lets you define your AI application’s logic as a graph. Think of the graph as a flowchart where:

Nodes are the individual steps (functions or tasks).

Edges define how you move from one node to the next.

Conditional edges allow you to decide dynamically which node to execute next based on the current state.


In our example, we’ll have:

1. A starting node that receives a user input.


2. A second node that processes the input.


3. A conditional edge that, based on the second node’s output, either executes a function (e.g., a tool call) or simply returns a prompt message.

Step-by-Step Example

Imagine you want to build a simple assistant that:

Starts with a greeting.

Processes a user question.

Then—depending on whether the assistant deems the answer acceptable—either calls an external function (say, a tool to do extra processing) or returns the answer as is.


1. Define the Nodes

a. The Starting Node:
This node receives the user input and simply passes it along.

def start_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # For example, state might include a message from the user.
    # This node simply passes the input forward.
    return {"message": state["user_input"]}

b. The Processing Node:
This node takes the message, processes it (e.g., simulates generating an answer), and adds a flag (answerok) to the state.

def process_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Simulate generating an answer.
    # (In a real application, this could call an LLM.)
    answer = f"Answer for: {state['message']}"
    # Let's assume our LLM decides if the answer is acceptable.
    # For demonstration, we set answerok to False if the message contains "bad".
    answerok = not ("bad" in state["message"].lower())
    return {"answer": answer, "answerok": answerok}

c. The Conditional Decision:
This is our conditional edge function. It checks if the answer is acceptable. Depending on that, it decides which next node to go to. Notice that it can also modify the state.

def decide_next_node(state: dict) -> str:
    # If the answer is not acceptable, we want to call a tool that does extra work.
    # Otherwise, we simply return the answer.
    if state.get("answerok") is False:
        # Optionally, you could modify the state here.
        # However, it's generally better to keep state updates in nodes.
        # For clarity, we keep the state unchanged here.
        return "tool_node"
    else:
        return "final_node"

2. Define the Extra Function (Tool)

Let’s define a tool that gets called when the answer is not acceptable. This tool might, for example, adjust the answer.

def tool_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Imagine this function improves the answer.
    improved_answer = state["answer"] + " [Improved with tool]"
    return {"answer": improved_answer}

3. The Final Node

If no extra processing is needed, we simply return the answer.

def final_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # The final output.
    return {"final_answer": state["answer"]}

4. Building the Graph

Now we “connect” these nodes together using LangGraph’s API. Although the actual LangGraph API uses classes, we’ll describe it conceptually.

1. Set the Entry Point: Start with the start_node.


2. Add an Edge: Connect the start node to the process node.


3. Add a Conditional Edge: After the process node, use the decide_next_node function to choose the next node:

If the condition returns "tool_node", execute the tool.

Otherwise, proceed directly to the final node.



4. If the Tool Node is executed: After it finishes, route back to the final node.



A pseudo-code representation of the graph building might look like this:

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

graph = StateGraph()

# Add nodes
graph.add_node("start_node", start_node)
graph.add_node("process_node", process_node)
graph.add_node("tool_node", tool_node)
graph.add_node("final_node", final_node)

# Define edges
graph.add_edge(START, "start_node")
graph.add_edge("start_node", "process_node")
graph.add_conditional_edges("process_node", decide_next_node,
                            { "tool_node": "tool_node", "final_node": "final_node" })
# If the tool was called, route its output to the final node.
graph.add_edge("tool_node", "final_node")
graph.add_edge("final_node", END)

# Compile and run the graph with an initial state
initial_state = {"user_input": "Tell me a good answer."}
result = graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(result)  # Expected to print the final answer.

5. Walking Through the Execution

Step 1:
The user input is received by start_node and stored in state["message"].

Step 2:
process_node uses that message to generate an answer and sets state["answerok"] (which becomes True if the input is good, or False if it contains “bad”).

Step 3:
The conditional edge function decide_next_node checks state["answerok"].

If the answer is acceptable (True), it returns "final_node".

Otherwise, it returns "tool_node".


Step 4:
If "tool_node" is chosen, the tool modifies the answer, appending "[Improved with tool]", then routes to "final_node".

Step 5:
final_node returns the final answer in state["final_answer"].

Conclusion

This example demonstrates LangGraph’s main concepts:

Nodes perform individual tasks (input processing, LLM calls, tool calls).

Edges (including conditional ones) define the dynamic flow of execution.

Conditional Edges let you branch the workflow based on the current state.


Even if you’re not yet familiar with Python classes, you can think of this graph as a series of functions (nodes) connected by “if-then” decisions (edges). This modular design makes it easier to build, test, and extend complex workflows.

By following this example, you can start to experiment with LangGraph for your own LLM applications. As you become more comfortable, you can explore more advanced features like persistence, human-in-the-loop, and streaming.
